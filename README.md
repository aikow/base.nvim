# Base Colorschemes for Neovim

This is a collection of colorschemes for neovim that all rely on defining 46
base colors, which are then used to populate all the highlight groups. Think of
it as a mediator or bridge between a colorscheme's base palette, and the
hundreds of neovim plugins and thousands of neovim highlight groups.
